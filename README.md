# 👋 Hi, I'm Nina - Growth Marketing Strategist & Developer 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub space!


After a successful career in the commercial sector, I've expanded my skills by specializing in Growth Marketing and acquiring a solid foundation in web development. My goal is to leverage these skills to drive sustainable growth for businesses and create innovative solutions.

## 🌱 Current Focus
I'm currently honing my skills in several key areas:

**Customer Acquisition and Retention:** Optimizing acquisition channels and developing retention strategies.

**Conversion Funnel Optimization:** Maximizing the efficiency of user journeys to increase conversion rates.

**Data-Driven Marketing:** Utilizing data for informed marketing decisions and successful experimentation.

**Web Development:** After completing a bootcamp at Le Wagon, I gained a strong foundation in coding, which allows me to better understand the development process and collaborate effectively with technical teams.

## 🛠️ Developed Project
During my development journey, I created Geeft, a web application that helps manage events and find the perfect gift for every occasion. This project allowed me to apply my skills in both front-end and back-end development, and to experience the creation of a digital solution from start to finish. **Discover [Geeft](https://www.geeft.club/) 🎁**
